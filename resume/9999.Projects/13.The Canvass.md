The Canvass is the first platform in economics that encourages and facilitates post-publication discussion. The Canvass also aims to encourage research by exposing ideas so that faculty, researchers, and students themselves develop a more nuanced understanding of important issues in economics. Researchers can subscribe to discussions so they will be notified of new development of the debate.
