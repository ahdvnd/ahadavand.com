Inequality.education will be a collaborative project by Barnard College students in the course Economics of Inequality, Aboozar Hadavand, and Sarah Thomas. This book will hopefully serve as a source, or an encyclopedia, for undergraduate students interested in inequality through an economic lens. The website will be ready soon and will be the first attempt to create a textbook for an undergraduate Economics of Inequality class.
