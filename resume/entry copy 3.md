Iâ€™m an assistant professor of Computational Sciences at Minerva Schools at Keck Graduate Institute and a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My current research involves analyzing Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) data. I received my Ph.D. in economics from the Graduate Center, CUNY in 2017. You can contact me here or DM @ahdvnd.
